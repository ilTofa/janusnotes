###Janus Notes

This software is deprecated. It uses deprecated API from Dropbox and has been superseded by [Janus Notes 2](https://github.com/ilTofa/janusnotes), also open source. Janus Notes 2 uses iCloud for data syncing and it still uses the same encryption mechanism as Janus Notes.

Janus Notes is a sync-capable notetaking app for iOS and OSX that
**seriously** respects your right to privacy.

 Janus Notes stores your data using strong encryption and synchronizes it
across different devices via Dropbox.  The name Janus is a reference to the ancient [Roman God Janus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus), depicted as having two faces since he looks to both future and past. Or perhaps, to cloud
storage and privacy. Or Macs and iPhone/iPad devices. Or sharing and control.

The app is available for free in the
[Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id651141191) and the iOS
[App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id651150600). Usage notes,
[FAQ](http://www.janusnotes.com/faq.html) and
[screenshots](http://www.janusnotes.com/screenshots.html) are available at
[janusnotes.com](http://www.janusnotes.com).

###The code

There are two Xcode 5 projects, one for iOS and the other for OS X,
respectively in the IPhone and Mac subdirectories. Forks and pull requests are
always welcome.

Both apps leverage the CoreData framework to locally store all notes and
attachments.  Optionally they may also sync via Dropbox, using the Dropbox Sync API on iOS and the filesystem on OS X. The Dropbox files may be encrypted with an user-defined passphrase. Encryption is performed by the
[RNCryptor](https://github.com/rnapier/RNCryptor) third-party library
developed by Rob Napier.

Release versions matching the binaries distributed in the Apple app stores may
be built after checking out the correspondingly tagged commits in the
repository.

The only required file not already in the repository is the **DropboxKeys.h**
header, containing the app key and the secret that you'll need to access the
Dropbox Sync API.  This is only required for the iOS version.

Create your DropboxKeys.h so that it contains two macro defs as follows:

	#define DROPBOX_APP_KEY @"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
	#define DROPBOX_SECRET  @"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

Replace the "xxx.." with your own key and secret.
